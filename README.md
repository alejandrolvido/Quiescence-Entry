# Quiescence-Entry

Code for analysis of time series derived from single cell measurements

The code used for each figure in "Cell cycle-independent integration of stress signals by Xbp1 promotes Non-G1/G0 quiescence entry" (Arguello-Miranda et al. 2021. JCB)  is in the corresponding folder

Code is deposited as script with detailed explanations of main steps

Functions required for each script are included in the corresponding folder

Data to analyze as example (Toy data) is included in each folder
 
The code should run on any Matlab release, but was written using the 2019 release 

Necessary functions and Toy data to recapitulate the main conlusions of each figure are supplied in the same folder

Just hit play on the editor and the analysis will be displayed

Please notice that the LDC analysis (LDC script in folder Fig5 might take some time to run through all the time points)

Please notice that the Pos3 folder in Fig1 folder needs to be un-zziped before analysis of the images
